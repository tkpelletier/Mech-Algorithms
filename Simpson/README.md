# Simpson.m
Simpson.m uses the Simpson 1/3 rule to estimate the integral of tabular data. If the data inputed has an odd number of intervals, the trapezoidal rule is used the calculate the last interval.
## Inputs
x - an array of x-values with equal spacing (same length as y)\
y - an array of y-values corresoponding to the x values
## Outputs
I - approximated integral using Simpson's 1/3 rule
